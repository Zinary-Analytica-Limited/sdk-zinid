# Progress

## Phase 0 — Scaffold (complete, 2026-07-27)

- pnpm workspace with `packages/sdk-web` (`@zinid/sdk-web`), laid out so a future
  `packages/react` and shared examples slot in without restructuring.
- TypeScript strict (`tsconfig.base.json`), tsup building four outputs from `src/index.ts`:
  `dist/zinid.js` (ESM), `dist/zinid.cjs` (CJS), `dist/zinid.min.js` (minified IIFE, global
  `ZinID`), `dist/zinid.d.ts`. package.json `exports`/`main`/`module`/`types`/`unpkg`/`jsdelivr`
  wired to them.
- Zero runtime dependencies; size-limit enforces an 8KB minified+gzipped budget on the IIFE
  bundle, wired into the `test` script.
- Vitest (Node env) with a placeholder test; Playwright installed, Chromium-only config, no
  specs yet.
- ESLint (flat config, typescript-eslint) + Prettier.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: install (frozen lockfile) → lint → typecheck → test (includes size
  budget). Node 24, checkout@v5 / setup-node@v5, concurrency cancel-in-progress.
- CLAUDE.md with stack + architectural rules; `.claude/settings.json`.

No SDK logic implemented yet — `src/index.ts` is a placeholder export.

## Phase 1 — Emitter + public types (complete, 2026-07-28)

Built test-first, with the test files reviewed and approved before implementation.

- `src/emitter.ts` — generic typed `Emitter<M>`, the single notification path for the whole SDK.
  Zero dependencies, no DOM, no window; safe to import during a server render.
  - Registration order preserved; duplicate registration of the same function is a no-op, so one
    `off` fully unsubscribes (`EventTarget` semantics, not Node's `EventEmitter`).
  - Mutation during an in-flight emit is well defined: iteration runs over a snapshot, so handlers
    added mid-emit wait for the next one, while each handler is re-checked against the live set, so
    one removed mid-emit does not run at all. Untouched handlers fire exactly once either way.
  - A throwing handler never interrupts the others; its error is re-thrown on a fresh task via
    `setTimeout`, reaching the global error handler with its stack intact rather than being
    swallowed or logged.
  - `clear(event?)` for teardown by the flow instance in a later phase.
  - Generic bound is `M extends object` rather than `Record<string, unknown>` so event maps
    declared as `interface` are accepted (an interface has no implicit index signature).
- `src/types.ts` — public type surface, types only, no runtime code. `SessionStatus` is exactly
  `Approved | Declined | Pending`; the backend collapses "In Review" into `Pending` before it
  reaches the SDK, and a type test guards against that leaking. `CompletePayload` mirrors the
  hosted contract verbatim. `ZinIDFlowOptions` sugar handlers (`onComplete` etc.) are asserted
  structurally identical to their `.on()` equivalents so the two can never drift.
- Tests: 53 passing — `src/emitter.test.ts` (runtime) and `src/types.test-d.ts` (type-level).
  Vitest `typecheck` mode is enabled in `vitest.config.ts`, since `expectTypeOf` and
  `@ts-expect-error` are erased at runtime and would otherwise assert nothing.
- Suite verified by mutation: leaking `'In Review'`, dropping the emit snapshot, and swallowing
  handler errors each fail the suite.

Not wired into `index.ts` — no factory, no channel, no modes, per the phase boundary. The size
budget therefore still measures only the placeholder (366 B gzipped of 8 KB); exporting the
emitter and types measures 533 B, so the budget has ample headroom.

## Phase 2 — next

The postMessage channel with origin guards: the parent-side half of the channel with the hosted
page, validating `event.origin` on every message before anything reaches the emitter. Per
CLAUDE.md this is vital logic — TDD, and stop for review of the test file before implementing.
